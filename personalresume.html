<p class="justify">Alexa Arboleda is a hardworking student at Barnard College, Columbia University. She studies economics and history, with a sharp lens for the Latin America, the effects on women, and the effects on children and their education. She leads by making sure that everyone is accounted for and by initiating ideas. She leads on her college campus through the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, which fosters Latino/a professionalism and Mujeres, which fosters Latino/a community that encourages Latinos to network and to introduce resources and ideas for ways to uplift our community. 

She is also an avid learner outside of the classroom, especially with matters of language and culture. She knows Spanish up to oral fluency with learning from home, has pursued French and its culture for four years in the International Baccalaureate Program, and then went on to introduce herself to Hindi and Urdu through a year of University studies in the language. Alexa hopes to continue gaining language skills throughout the course of her undergraduate experience either through current languages or adding another, such as German or Portuguese. 

Alexa has cultivated a love for education and teaching from a very young age and up until now has had many roles in this area. She has been a teacher, tutor, mentor, and assistant to teachers. However, now as a student of economics, Alexa wish to address the issues of access to education, women empowerment, and the growth and development of Latin America and all of the subtopics that this entails through a more macro perspective that includes but is not limited to trade, monetary policy, and investment in Latin America and elsewhere to begin to solve issues of social justice. As Alexa continues to gain academic experience through coursework, she hope to complement this with professional and hands-on experiences along the way.
